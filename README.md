UIWebView-Blocks
================

UIWebView+Blocks is A simple category that implements blocks into UIWebView.
This allows you to use the power of blocks instead of implementing a delegate.

USAGE FOR NSURLRequests
------

Instead of allocating a new UIWebView and assigning a delegate, just call one of the static methods:

    UIWebView *webView = [UIWebView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL: [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://google.com"]]
                                         loaded:^(UIWebView *webView) {
                                             NSLog(@"Loaded successfully");
                                         }
                                         failed:^(UIWebView *webView, NSError *error) {
                                             NSLog(@"Failed loading %@", error);
                                         }];

**OR**

	UIWebView *webView = [UIWebView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL: [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://google.com"]]
                                         loaded:^(UIWebView *webView) {
                                             NSLog(@"Loaded successfully");
                                         }
                                         failed:^(UIWebView *webView, NSError *error) {
                                             NSLog(@"Failed loading %@", error);
                                         }
                                    loadStarted:^(UIWebView *webView) {
                                        NSLog(@"Started loading %@", webView.request.URL.absoluteString);
                                    }
                                     shouldLoad:^BOOL(UIWebView *webView, UIWebViewNavigationType navigationType) {
                                         return YES;
                                     }];
                                 
                             
USAGE FOR HTML Strings
-------

    UIWebView *webView = [UIWebView loadHTMLString:htmlString
                                            loaded:^(UIWebView *) {
                                                NSLog(@"Loaded successfully");
                                            }
                                            failed:^(UIWebView *, NSError *) {
                                                 NSLog(@"Failed loading %@", error);
                                            }];
    
**OR**

    UIWebView *webView = [UIWebView loadHTMLString:htmlString
                                            loaded:^(UIWebView *) {
                                                NSLog(@"Loaded successfully");
                                            }
                                            failed:^(UIWebView *, NSError *) {
                                                 NSLog(@"Failed loading %@", error);
                                            }
                                       loadStarted:^(UIWebView *webView) {
                                           NSLog(@"Started loading %@", webView.request.URL.absoluteString);
                                       }
                                        shouldLoad:^BOOL(UIWebView *webView, NSURLRequest *request, UIWebViewNavigationType navigationType) {
                                            return YES;
                                        }];


The class will return the UIWebView object which you can later add as a subview to your current view.

	webView.frame = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds];
    [self.view addSubview: webView];
    
***Note:*** UIWebView+Blocks currently doesn't support the simultaneous usage of multiple UIWebViews in the same view.
    
TRUE ENDING REPORTING
---------------------

In UIWebView+Blocks.h, set `TRUE_END_REPORT` to YES if you wish to get notified only when the page is fully loaded instead of being notified every time a resource is loaded (default UIWebViewDelegate behavior).
This feature is still under beta and might not work perfectly at all times.
